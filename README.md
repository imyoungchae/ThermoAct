# ThermoAct: Thermal-Aware Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Perception and Decision-Making


In recent human-robot collaboration environments, there is a growing focus on integrating diverse sensor data beyond visual information to enable safer and more intelligent task execution. Although thermal data can be crucial for enhancing robot safety and operational efficiency, its integration has been relatively overlooked in prior research. This paper proposes a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that incorporates thermal information for robot task execution. The proposed system leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a high-level planner to interpret complex natural language commands and decompose them into simpler sub-tasks. This approach facilitates efficient data collection and robust reasoning for complex operations. Unlike conventional methods that rely solely on visual data, our approach integrates thermal information, enabling the robot to perceive physical properties and proactively ensure environmental safety. Experimental results from real-world task scenarios validate the feasibility of our proposed framework, suggesting its potential to enhance task success rates and safety compared to existing vision-based systems.
